## dubtrack-tweaks (originally "dubtrack-upvote")

### Features: ##


 - Automatically "updub" (upvote) songs a few seconds after they start (or visiting a room).
 - Allows you to mute music by simply pressing the spacebar anywhere within the window (except in chat).
 - Added the "Permalink" to the right of song titles so that now you can FINALLY visit *currently*
   playing SoundCloud (and YouTube) songs by simply clicking a link.

### Instructions: ##

1. In chrome, download/install Tampermonkey here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
2. In Tampermonkey options, go to "Create new Script"
3. Copy/paste these entire contents.
4. Visit dubtrack.fm and enter a room.
5. Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled (click the Tampermonkey icon and select "Enabled").

Note: These instructions are for Chrome users, but installation should be very similar if you're
using Firefox. For Firefox, you'll need to setup and use Greasemonkey instead of Tampermonkey
which can be found here: http://userscripts-mirror.org/about/installing.html
